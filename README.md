# python-challenge
This weeks module challenge involved pulling csv files from the resources files for PyPoll and PyBank. PyBank holds the budget_data which is a csv file with 2 columns of dates and profit/losses. The goal for was to write a script that can output total number of months, net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, average difference in profit/losses from month to month, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. The code outputs a text file with the analysis data. Same for PyPoll, we were given the election_data csv file. In specific counties, 3 candidates were racing for votes. The goal was to create a script that analyzed total number of votes, complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes per candidate, and lastly the winner. Again, I added script that outputs the text file with the results.
I collaborated on this code with Nicolas and Brendan.
